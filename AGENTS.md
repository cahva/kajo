# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Built-in Commands vs Scripts

`vp <name>` runs a built-in command. `vp run <name>` runs a `package.json` script or a `vite.config.ts` task. Scripts cannot overwrite built-ins, so `vp dev` and `vp run dev` may do different things. Check `package.json` and `vite.config.ts` first, and run `vp run <name>` when the project defines a script or task with that name.

## Tool Versions

Run `vp toolchain` to show versions and relationships in the active Vite+
release. Add a tool name to select part of the graph. For example, run
`vp toolchain vite`. Use `--global` to ignore the local `vite-plus` package. Use
`vp why <package>` to show the package-manager dependency graph.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.
- [ ] If setup, runtime, or package-manager behavior looks wrong, run `vp env doctor` and include its output when asking for help.

## Releasing

Kajo publishes to JSR as `@cahva/kajo` from `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

1. Open a release-prep PR: rename `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` to
   `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, add a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` above it,
   update the link references at the bottom, and set `"version"` to `X.Y.Z` in
   both `jsr.json` and `package.json`.
2. Merge it to `main`.
3. Tag the merge commit with a signed annotated tag and push it:
   `git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
4. The workflow refuses unsigned or lightweight tags, tags not contained in
   `main`, and versions that do not match both manifests. It then runs CI,
   publishes to JSR over OIDC, and creates the GitHub release with the
   changelog section as notes.

Never publish from a local machine; JSR versions cannot be replaced.
